## My process

**HTML Structure**

I started by using a semantic tag section with class "container" and then put another div inside named "preview".

I placed the Card image inside the preview div.

I add main to hold my text and add h1, and my list for the author pics and name and paragraphs in it.

I also create another the footer for attribution to frontEnd mentor and myside "#".

**CSS Styling**
I add the font on the folder already by using the @facefont rule. 

I add a universal selector(*) to set margin and padding to 0 

Then use the body selector to add background-color and other styles to the body.


### Built with
- Semantic HTML tags
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
 
 This help me to understand CSS flexbox more.
 I'll be trying Grid layout soon ðŸ”œ.
