## My process

**HTML Structure**

1. I began with a semantic `<section>` tag, assigning the class 'container'.
2. Inside the 'container', I placed another `<div>` named 'preview'.
3. I added the card image within the 'preview' div.
4. Introducing a `<main>` element, I organized text, including `<h1>` and a list for author pictures, names, and paragraphs.
5. For attribution, I created a footer linking to Frontend Mentor and my personal site '#'.

**CSS Styling**
1. I included the font using the `@font-face` rule.
2. To ensure consistency, I applied a universal selector `(*)`, setting margin and padding to 0.
3. I used the `body` selector to implement background-color and other styles.



### Built with
- Semantic HTML tags
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
 
 This helps me to understand CSS flexbox more.
 I'll be trying Grid layout soon ðŸ”œ.
